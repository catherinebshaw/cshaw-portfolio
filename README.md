# Catherine Shaw's Portfolio

Thanks for taking the time to look at my portfolio. This app provides a brief overview of my career and access to some of my recent work in webdevelopment. I would love to hear from you if you have any suggestions or questions. My personal information is available in the Contact section. 

## User Experience

Users are presented with three main pages:
* About Page - provides a brief overview of my career and skills
* Portfolio - provides a short description of the application together with a screen shot and links to the deployed site and the code repository on GitHub.
* Contact - Users have access to all my contact information including phone, email, LinkedIn profile and GitHub profile. Users can also download a copy of my resume. 

## Technology Used

This application was built using ReactJS. It employs Javascript, CSS and HTML and also includes additional packages such as react-router-dom and react-icons. The application has been deployed on heroku and runs as a standard web page. To run locally, open the SRC file in the integrated terminal and type "NPM start".  The site will be served on localhost:3000.
